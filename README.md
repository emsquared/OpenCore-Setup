# OpenCore Setup

This is my personal configuration for running a Hackintosh using [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).

![Setup Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emsquared/OpenCore-Setup/master/Images/Setup.png)

I am uploading this as a public repository for two purposes:
1. Allow myself to keep track of changes I make and back them up.
2. Allow others with similiar hardware to find a _possibly_ suitable configuration.

# Hardware

* Cooler Master GM Series G650M
* MSI MPG Z390 GAMING PLUS
* Intel 9900K**F**
* XFX Radeon VII 16GB
* HyperX Fury 32GB (2 x 16GB) 3200MHz DDR4
* Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500GB
* 8TB hard disk storage (2 x 4TB)
* Nixeus EDG 27" 1440p IPS display (NX-EDG27S v2) 

None of this hardware is overclocked.

_Note: My CPU comes without integrated graphics because it was cheaper and I have a dedicated GPU. **I therefore do not know if this configuration will work with integrated graphics.**_

Wifi and Bluetooth work with zero configuration, out of the box, thanks to [this card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012LOT512/r).

# Disclaimer

I am a novice when it comes to building a hackintosh. I do not understand a lot of what happens behind the scenes. This configuration is a combination of the helpful [vanilla guide](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/) and [reading the entire docuemtnation](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf).

**I DO NOT provide any gurantees for this setup outside of my own use case.**
